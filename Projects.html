    <!-- Tootsie Pop Experiment -->
    <section>
        <h2>Fun & Silly: The Tootsie Pop Experiment</h2>
        <p>Did you know? It took me about 180 licks to reach the center of a Tootsie Pop when I was in 3rd grade. I recently revisited this classic experiment, and the results were a bit surprising!</p>
        <details>
            <summary>Click to learn more about the experiment</summary>
            <p>
                In my original experiment, I counted each lick meticulously. During my recent attempt, I used a newer batch of Tootsie Pops, and it turns out I needed fewer licks to reach the center. Was it due to a manufacturing change or my improved technique? The world may never know! <br>

    <!-- HTML Portfolio Project -->
    <section>
        <h2>Building My HTML Portfolio</h2>
        <p>This website is the result of my first steps in web development. I've built it from scratch using HTML and CSS, applying design principles to ensure clarity and professionalism.</p>
        <details>
            <summary>Click to see more details about this project</summary>
            <p>
                In this project, I learned the fundamentals of web development, including how to structure content with HTML and style it with CSS. The goal was to create a personal portfolio that effectively showcases my skills and achievements in cybersecurity, cryptography, and coding.<br>
                This project also involved deploying virtual machines to simulate real-world hacking and encryption scenarios, using tools like John the Ripper for password cracking and other encryption techniques.

    <!-- Cryptography Class Project -->
    <section>
        <h2>Cryptography Classwork</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite subjects is cryptography. I've worked on various encryption methods and number theory concepts, including RSA and AES.</p>
        <details>
            <summary>Click to explore my cryptography projects</summary>
            <p>
                In my cryptography class, I worked on solving complex problems using RSA, Euclidean algorithms, and more. This course helped me gain a deeper understanding of how encryption protects data and the importance of secure communication.<br>

    <!-- Coding Projects (Java & Python) -->
    <section>
        <h2>Coding History: Java & Python Projects</h2>
        <p>I've developed a strong foundation in programming through various projects using Java and Python. These languages are crucial for both cybersecurity and general software development.</p>
        <details>
            <summary>Click to see some of my coding work</summary>
            <p>
                From creating small Java applications to automating tasks with Python, I have experience in building efficient code for various purposes. One project involved developing a simple encryption algorithm in Python, which further deepened my understanding of how programming and cryptography intersect.

    <!-- SQL Database Project -->
    <section>
        <h2>SQL Database Tables</h2>
        <p>Working with relational databases has given me insight into the structured storage of data. I've been creating tables and learning to manipulate data with SQL.</p>
        <details>
            <summary>Click to view my SQL projects</summary>
            <p>
                In this project, I created and managed multiple SQL database tables, ensuring proper relationships between data. I learned to perform complex queries, joins, and data manipulations to extract meaningful insights from raw datasets. These skills are directly applicable to cybersecurity, where data management plays a crucial role in security auditing and analysis.
